# CopyOnSelect

Copy on select plugin for [Sublime Text 3][].

Install via [package control][] by going to `Command Palette → Package Control: Add Repository`, adding this repository, then installing as `CopyOnSelect`.

Use of a clipboard manager is highly recommended — I use [Copied][] and love it.
